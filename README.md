# neural-network-from-scratch
Implementation of a feed-forward neural network from scratch using only NumPy. The neural network is capable of deep learning, so 
it can take on any number of layers. The neural network can only be used for binary classification. The Sigmoid function is used
for the activation function and the cross entropy function is used for the loss function.
